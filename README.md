Analysis of Uber Pickup Patterns in New York City

**Project Description**
This project leverages data science to analyze Uber pickup data across New York City, identifying high-demand zones to optimize vehicle deployment and enhance service efficiency. By utilizing clustering techniques, such as K-Means, this analysis helps in strategically positioning vehicles, which potentially reduces wait times and increases customer satisfaction.

#### **Installation**
To set up this project locally, follow the steps below:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vedantbohat/UML-Uber-Project
cd uber-pickup-analysis
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### **Usage**
Run the project using the following command:
```bash
python run_analysis.py
```
This script processes the Uber data, applies clustering algorithms, and outputs visualization maps and cluster data summaries.

**Contributing**
Contributions to this project are welcome. To contribute:
1. Fork the project.
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/NewFeature`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some NewFeature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/NewFeature`).
5. Open a new Pull Request.

**Data Collection**
Data for this analysis was sourced from Uber's open dataset covering pickups from April to September 2014 in New York City. The dataset includes date/time, pickup locations, and base codes.

**Results**
Key findings:
- High-demand zones predominantly in Manhattan, especially during rush hours.
- Clusters identified are critical for strategic vehicle placement during peak and off-peak hours.

Visualizations and detailed analysis are available in the `results` directory.

**Limitations**
This study is constrained by:
- Data covering only a six-month period, limiting the understanding of annual trends.
- Potential biases in pickup data due to external factors like weather or special events.
